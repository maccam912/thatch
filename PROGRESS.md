# Thatch Roguelike Development Progress

## Project Overview
Thatch is a deep, complex roguelike game written in Rust that integrates an LLM as a Dungeon Master (LLDM). The game features procedural dungeon generation with LLM-generated unique items and narrative elements, designed with MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for external control.

## What I've Completed ✅

### 1. Project Setup & Architecture
- **CLAUDE.md**: Created comprehensive development guidelines with strict documentation, testing, and naming standards
- **Cargo.toml**: Set up with all necessary dependencies including crossterm, serde, tokio, proptest, ratatui, pathfinding, noise, and MCP-related crates
- **Feature flags**: Added for dev-tools, ai-player, and mcp-server modes
- **Directory structure**: Created modular structure with game/, generation/, rendering/, input/, lldm/, utils/ modules

### 2. Core Game Systems
- **Position & Direction**: Complete 2D coordinate system with distance calculations and movement deltas
- **Entity System**: Trait-based entity system with PlayerCharacter implementation, stats, inventory, equipment
- **Game Events**: Comprehensive event system for entity interactions, damage, movement, items
- **Game State**: Central state management with entity tracking, position indexing, turn management, statistics
- **Action System**: Command pattern for all game actions (move, attack, wait) with MCP-compatible serialization

### 3. World & Level System
- **Tile Types**: Wall, Floor, Door, Stairs, Water, Special (for LLDM content)
- **Level**: 2D grid system with visibility, exploration tracking, entity management
- **World**: Multi-level world with level transitions and metadata support

### 4. Procedural Generation
- **Generation Framework**: Extensible generator trait system with LLDM integration points
- **Room System**: Detailed room structures with types (Normal, Treasure, Boss, Shop, Puzzle, etc.)
- **Dungeon Generator**: Room-and-corridor algorithm with multiple placement and connection strategies
- **Configuration**: Flexible generation parameters for room sizes, densities, LLDM enhancement

### 5. Testing & Quality
- **Comprehensive tests**: Unit tests for all major components
- **Property-based testing setup**: Ready for complex game mechanic validation
- **Documentation**: Every public function has rustdoc with examples
- **Error handling**: Custom error types with proper propagation

## What's Still Needed 🚧

   - [ ] Crossterm-based display with field of view
   - [ ] UI components for health, inventory, messages
   - [ ] Color schemes and visual effects
   - [ ] Map rendering with explored/visible tile states

2. **Player Movement & Controls** (`src/input/`)
   - [ ] Input handling with crossterm
   - [ ] Command parsing and validation
   - [ ] Keybinding system

### Medium Priority (Enhancement)
4. **Development Tools**
   - [ ] Debug commands (reveal map, teleport, god mode)
   - [ ] Level editor/viewer
   - [ ] Statistics dashboard
   - [ ] Performance profiling tools
   - [ ] Console command system

5. **AI Player System**
   - [ ] Simple AI that can navigate and play
   - [ ] Pathfinding integration using pathfinding crate
   - [ ] Behavior tree or state machine
   - [ ] Demonstration and testing capabilities
   - [ ] AI vs AI gameplay modes

6. **MCP Server Interface**
   - [ ] JSON-RPC server for external control
   - [ ] Action serialization/deserialization (mostly done)
   - [ ] Player perspective API
   - [ ] Real-time game state streaming
   - [ ] Authentication and session management

### Lower Priority (Advanced Features)
7. **LLDM Integration**
   - [ ] HTTP client for LLM APIs
   - [ ] Content generation prompts
   - [ ] Response parsing and integration
   - [ ] Caching and rate limiting
   - [ ] Context management for narrative continuity

   - [ ] Item generation (`generation/items.rs`)
   - [ ] Monster/NPC generation with AI behaviors
   - [ ] Encounter placement (`generation/encounters.rs`)
   - [ ] Advanced dungeon algorithms (BSP, cellular automata)
   - [ ] Biome and theme systems

9. **Save/Load System**
   - [ ] JSON serialization (foundation done)
   - [ ] File I/O with error handling
   - [ ] Version compatibility and migration
   - [ ] Compressed save files

10. **Advanced Features**
    - [ ] Combat system expansion (weapons, armor, effects)
    - [ ] Magic/spell system
    - [ ] Crafting system
    - [ ] Quest/story system
    - [ ] Multiplayer support

## Key Design Decisions Made 🎯

1. **MCP-First Architecture**: All actions are serializable commands for future LLM integration
2. **Entity-Component Pattern**: Flexible system using traits for different entity types
3. **Event-Driven Updates**: Game events drive state changes and UI updates
4. **Procedural + LLM**: Traditional algorithms enhanced by LLM-generated content
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Property-based testing for game mechanics validation
6. **Modular Design**: Clear separation between rendering, logic, generation, and I/O
